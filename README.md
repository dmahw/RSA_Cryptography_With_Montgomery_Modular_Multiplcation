## Notes:
Inside this zip file contains the project report, optimized c code, optimized assembly code, and associated .mdj files for the StarUML diagrams. If you do not have a program to open the associated .mdj files, an image has been provided of each of the diagrams used for this project.

## Instructions:

To run the optimized C code:
1. Compile with `gcc rsaCryptography.c -lm`
2. Run with `./a.out`
3. Output will print the original, encrypted, and decrypted version of the predefined input

To run the optimized assembly code:
1. Compile with `gcc rsaCryptography.s -o assembly.out`
2. Run with `./assembly.out`
3. Output will print the original, encrypted, and decrypted version of the predefined input
